# Black-Flash

## Inverts Screen to make the Flashbang effect in CS:GO black. That helps people who are very photosensitive.

There is another Program that was made after mine. Its better in most ways so I recommend using this:
<a href="https://github.com/dev7355608">csgo_dont_blind_me</a>

Installation for people who cant build from source:

Donwload the latest Installer from https://palone.top/blackflash/bf.exe and execute it. 

You now will have the shortcuts for the BlackFlash.exe and the NegativeScreen.exe on your Desktop. You also will have a shortcut for the gamestate_integration_pl.cfg on there as well.

You have to put the .cfg in (your steam directory)\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg

Then start the NegativeScreen.exe and after that the BlackFlash.exe.

(When you start NegativeScreen it will make the Screen Negative once. Click on your system tray and right click on the NegativScreen -> Toggle Inversion)

This program only works on windowed or Fullscreen windowed mode.

NegativeScreen requires a 64-bit OS.
